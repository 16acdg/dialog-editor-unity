# dialog-editor-unity
Custom dialog GUI editor for the Unity game engine.
Displays conversation prompts as nodes in a graph. Selecting a node response will take the user to a new conversation prompt.

Almost done creating an easy way for the plugin to be added.

## Next Steps
Next steps include persisting dialog graphs, allowing dialog responses to trigger events, and posting the project to the Unity Asset Store.
