# dialog-editor-unity
Custom dialog GUI editor for the Unity game engine.
Visually displays conversation as a series of nodes in a graph.

Feel free to use this code in any of your projects. I will probably try to put it on the Unity Asset Store in the near future.

Currently working on documentation of this project.
